# Krita Scripts

Small Krita scripts that I find useful for automating some tasks.


## Bash Scripts
### rofi-krita
A script used for opening template files using rofi.

### tablet-sway-config

A script used for configuring a drawing tablet for use with the Sway
window manager.

## Plugins

### file_layer_importer

Quickly import file layers using rofi.

## Scripts

### rectangle_to_layer
Capture a rectangle selection from the screen to a new layer.

### rectangle_to_reference
Capture a rectangle selection from the screen to a new reference.

### wl_color_picker
Use wl_color_picker to pick a color, then set the foreground color to it.

### next_page
Move to the next sway active window and press space and then h. For
use with the zathura reader, it goes to the next page and then to the
top of the page.

### fill_shrank_selection

Fill the current selection shrunk by a pixel.

### outline_selection

Create a selection using the select contiguous tool second by the
select opaque tool; then enlarge the selection by a pixel and create a
new layer using the selection. Useful for creating crude outlines or a
silhouette of the selection.

## Makefile

Automate the installation of Krita plugins.
